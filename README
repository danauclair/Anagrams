Anagrams

This is a simple Ruby on Rails app that searches for anagrams based on input letters as you type. The results are sorted by Scrabble/WWF word scores.

Uses a SQLite database seeded by the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (enable1.txt - http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/enable1.txt) dictionary which is the same as used by Words With Friends.
